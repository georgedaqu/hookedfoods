				<p>Every decision taken at Hooked, relating to anything from our products, sources, packaging or transport, is a thought-through process with our mission in mind. We continuously ask ourselves: &quot;Does this enable us to better lead the transition to a healthier seafood ecosystem?&quot;</p>
				<p>In some areas, we've come very far in how our work positively impacts our climate and people, whereas in some areas we still have work to do. Obviously, we're not perfect. With transparency as one of our six core values, we're always aiming to ride the wave of change with openness and honesty. Let's dive into the hottest topics!

			<div class="default_text">
				<p>When measuring the impact of Toonish versus regular tuna, we look at three variables: Number of saved fishes, saved CO2 emissions and the amount of micro plastics that consumers avoid when choosing Toonish.</p>

				<div class="default_text">
					<p><u>Number of saved fishes:</u> We estimate that for every sold kilo of Toonish as a replacement of regular tuna, 0.24 fishes are saved. This calculation is based on the assumption that every purchase of Toonish is made instead of tuna.</p>
					<p>Although, we're aware that sometimes Toonish is chosen instead of tofu, chicken or falafel. Currently we don't have data on how many meals of Toonish that actually replaces tuna, but we're working on it.</p>

					<h3>Saved CO2 emissions:</h3>
					<p>3.36 tons of CO2 emissions are saved for every kilo Toonish sold. The CO2 emissions from canned tuna is estimated to 6.06 tons per kilo. This is based on <a href="http://static.ewg.org/reports/2011/meateaters/pdf/methodology_ewg_meat_eaters_guide_to_health_and_climate_2011.pdf" target="_blank">this report</a>. The emissions from Hooked Toonish are 2.7 tons per kilo, creating a difference of 3.36 tons of saved CO2 emissions.</p>

			<div class="default_text">
				<p>You're not the only one craving plain Toonish in the grocery stores. We hear you. Our ambition has always been to sell plain Toonish in the stores, but Toonish is currently too expensive to reach an acceptable consumer price when sold on its own, so that's why we created Toonish Tomato in the meantime, while figuring out the price point and packaging solution for the plain one. Hatoona Matata fish lovers, we're working on it!</p>

				<p>The Hooked crew is a blissful mix of creative doers that love food. Some of us are vegans, some are vegetarians, pescatarians or flexitarians and some of us prefer to not have a label. We embrace all consumers and don't judge anyone based on their diet type. What draws us together is that we're all aligned about our mission to lead the transition to a healthier seafood ecosystem, by delivering delicious plant-based seafood for everyone to enjoy.
